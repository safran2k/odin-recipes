    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>90g Oats</li>
        <li>1 or 2 Bananas</li>
        <li>60g Peanut Butter</li>
        <li>250ml Milk</li>
        <li>10g sunflower seeds</li>
        <li>Water (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the oats, peanut butter and milk in a blender</li>
        <li>Slice the banana and throw it in the blender too. <em>Note: the ideal number of bananas to use is 1 and a half, so I recommend saving half of the banana 
            for another day. If you don't want to do this then you can simply choose to use 1 or 2 bananas depending on how sweet you want it</em>
        </li>
        <li>Start blending!</li>
        <li>Once blended, finally add the sunflower seeds for an extra crunch. Make sure you have de-shelled them if they're not pre de-shelled</li>
        <li>If the consistency of the shake is too thick for you to get down, feel free to add some water and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
